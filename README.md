# Code-Refactor
A marketing agency requested me to optimize their site for search engines.

I cleaned up the redundant CSS properties and condensed .benefits along with .main-contents.
Also relabeling the <div> to more specific tags based on location in HTML. 
  I was not sure exactly what I was looking for or what I needed to do until I realized how redundant some of the CSS coding was.
